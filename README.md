# MiniOCaml
a DIY programming language created through OCaml

MiniCAML adds n-ary function abstraction and application, and recursion. Compared to OCaml, MiniCAML lacks pattern matching, user-defined datatypes, exceptions, and modules.

The goal of implementing a new programming language that is similar to OCaml is to explore concepts such as free variables, substitution, evaluation, type checking, and type inference.
